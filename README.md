This is my assignment 3 for AGRO 932

In this repo you can find a GWAS conducted Using rice data from (Zhao et al., 2011)
In the GWAS.R file you can find step by step how I did the GWAS using R, HCC, PLINK, GEMMA

In the folder ldata/RiceDiversity_44K_Genotypes_PLINK/output you can find the results of the GWAS
in the "Plant.length.assoc" file

In the folder graphs you can find the visual results in pdf files

The file "manhattan" located in "graphs" folde r in showing a manhattan plot from
the GWAS study that I ran for Panicle Length. I discover in chromosome 11 one GWAS signal.
It could be possible that this marker is indicating a strong association for panicel length.
In the future, this marker can be validated in a study with more genotypes and in different
environments/years. With this validation, marker assisted selection can be used in breeding
programs to select lines by this important trait that is related with yield in maize.
